# Toxo_delivery_Bracha_et_al_2024
Code and links to data for Bracha et al, 2024

In the codes you can find:
1. CellProfiller piplines for image analysis of the infected HFF and infected LUHMES neurons datasets. 
2. Codes for the analysis of the image analysis outputs. The results from this are presented in figure 4 (kinetics of T. gondii infection and protein delivery in HFF and neurons). 
3. Code for analysis and plotting of the intrinsic disorder profiles of the GRA16 fusion proteins, calculating intinsic disorder score and analysing the correlation between the intrinsic disorder score and nuclear localization.
4. ImageJ macro files used for extracting the point-spread-function (PSF) and performing deconvolution of the microscopy raw files. Using the following plugins: http://www.optinav.info/Iterative-Deconvolve-3D.htm http://www.optinav.info/Diffraction-PSF-3D.htm Ref: Dougherty, R.P., "Extensions of DAMAS and benefits and limitations of deconvolution in beamforming", AIAA Paper 2005-2961, May, 2005.


The following data can be found on https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eT86CSqSS20FES8xOm6zeT6pe3piw7-A :
1. data for the kinteics analysis codes (HFF_cellprofiler_outputs.zip and luhmes_cellprofiler_outputs.zip)
2. All raw microscopy files and metadata 
3. Intrinsic disorder profiles of all tested GRA16 fusion proteins, calculated using: https://iupred2a.elte.hu
